		  <h2>Hello!</h2>
		  <p>I'm Nagarjun but you can call me Nag. I'm the <strong>Founder &amp; CEO at 
		  	<a href="http://www.eduora.com/">Eduora</a></strong>, a mobile learning company that I founded while I 
		  	was still in college. I'm also a full-stack web developer &amp; designer.</p>
		  <p>I absolutely enjoy creating great products built around solid user-interfaces. My work is mostly 
		  	web-based however, I've had the chance to craft mobile applications more recently for Eduora.</p>
		  <p>I built an interest for startups &amp; entrepreneurship at a very young age. My first company 
		  	was a services business that I started back in the 9th grade after winning a global Microsoft 
		  	competition. I won a much-needed HP server that also caught the attention of the press after I had secretly 
		  	participated in my father's name as I was under-age. I also ran one of India's largest developer group 
		  	(alongside <a href="http://www.janakiramm.net/">Janakiram M</a>) after high-school &amp; participated in (and won) a few 
		  	more competitions.</p>
		  <p>I've always wanted to build a products-based company (a scarcity in India) &amp; I realized this dream when I 
		  	started Eduora. Much credit goes to <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/abhishek-rungta">Abhishek 
		  	Rungta</a> and 
		  	<a href="http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-07-03/news/32525089_1_bangur-new-office-charting-growth">Pallav Nadhani</a> for getting me started.</p>
		  <p>Among other things, I'm deeply interested in the future of technology, wearable computing, aviation, space, 
		  	public speaking, travel &amp; urban-planning. You may also find me glued to CNN or BBC if I have the TV on.</p>
		  <h3>A Quick Note About Eduora</h3>
		  <p>Eduora is building the world's first mobile-learning platform for higher-education. More than 70% students 
		  	are carrying their smartphones to class once they reach high-school &amp; this is set to grow further. The 
		  	Eduora mobile app gathers highly granular data about students by using a feedback loop built into the remaining 
		  	collaborative functions. It's the easiest way to get a highly-functional &amp; branded mobile app 
		  	for your campus.</p>
		  <p>Eduora was also the <strong>first international startup to graduate from The Alchemist Accelerator</strong>
		  	in Silicon Valley. Learn more <a href="http://www.eduora.com/">here</a>.</p>
