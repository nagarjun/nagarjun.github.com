The iPhone 5S has a fingerprint reader but, it isn't revolutionary because of it's function. The iPhone 5S fingerprint reader is revolutionary because it is invisible.

Many phones have had fingerprint readers that essentially served as a security layer much like the iPhone 5S. However, none had the right software to support it or had a design that made it appeal to the masses.

On a side note, I think the Apple M7 chip will propel the [Quantified Self Movement][quantified-self]. The potential for a wide range of self-tracking applications will make it an ideal device for people to discover the advantages of Quantified Self.
