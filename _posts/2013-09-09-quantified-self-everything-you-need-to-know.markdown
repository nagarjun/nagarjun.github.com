It's been a great year for wearable technology. The market for everything from [fitness bands (Jawbone Up, FitBit, Nike FuelBand)][jawbone-up] to [smartwatches (Pebble, Galaxy Gear)][galaxy-gear] and even a [fitness tracker for your dog][fit-bark] are growing. One company is also building a [biometric band (Nymi)][nymi] that uses your unique echocardiogram to replace passwords. All of this is fueling an incredible amount of interest in the *Quantified Self Movement*.

Beyond the frenzy for wearables, Quantified Self has numerous applications and potential for wider impact.

### What is Quantified Self? ###
[Quantified Self][quantified-self] is a movement that promises to help people by collecting data across all aspects of a person's life. While the term itself was proposed in 2007 by Wired's Gary Wolf and Kevin Kelly, many people have been logging their lives even before that. This can include anything from a person's dietary intake to sleep and even a log of your personal communications.

Stephen Wolfram, the famous British scientist has been collecting data about himself for decades. He's probably the best example and  even [published a detailed analysis of his life][stephen-wolfram]. It's a must read for anyone looking to understand how this data can actually tell you more about yourself and improve your life.

Unlike Wolfram, most people don't have the right tools or PhDs to help collect this data but, new technologies are making it easier. Fitness trackers and bands are just one part of the equation.

### What can you learn from this data? ###
Want to know if your blood sugar levels are correct? How do your sleep patterns compare to others your age and with your body composition? Want to sequence your DNA? Want to know why you haven't been energetic lately? These are just some questions you can answer with the right data.

Let's use an analogy. Many countries use sensors that are installed in roads to log traffic. Over time, this large dataset can help you accurately predict traffic congestions months ahead! What if you could use data to prevent obesity or something more serious? The possibilities are endless and we're only beginning to understand its potential.

My Jawbone Up helps me analyze idle time sitting in front a computer (something I do a lot professionally). Initial data showed me that I've been sitting idle for 3 hours at a time. While I tried to be more cautious, I never logged this data so I could *exactly quantify* it and take action. I've tweaked my personality to now take short breaks every 45 minutes and I feel more refreshed.

Technology is making it possible to collect data about *you as an individual* for the first time. When combined with the data collected by everyone, we will have unprecedented knowledge about humanity.

Vinod Khosla made an argument for how algorithms can make healthcare more accurate and efficient in: [Do We Need Doctors Or Algorithms?][vinod-khosla]

>"The history of symptoms, illnesses, and test results could be accessed, processed, and assessed by a computer to see any correlation or trends with the patientâ€™s past. You are the one providing the doctor with the symptoms anyway after all!" - Vinod Khosla

It's a bold statement and definitely worth a read.
