It's been a great year for wearable technology. The market for everything from [fitness bands (Jawbone Up, FitBit, Nike FuelBand)][jawbone-up] to [smartwatches (Pebble, Galaxy Gear)][galaxy-gear] and even a [fitness tracker for your dog][fit-bark] are growing. One company is also building a [biometric band (Nymi)][nymi] that uses your unique echocardiogram to replace the password! All of this is fueling an incredible amount of interest in the *Quantified Self Movement*.

Beyond the frenzy for wearables, Quantified Self has numerous other applications and a wider impact.
