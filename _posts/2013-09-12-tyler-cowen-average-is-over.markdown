I'm adding a new book to my reading list today. [Tyler Cowen's][tyler-cowen] much anticipated book ['Average is Over'][amazon-book] is out now and a must read for anyone interested in economics. For those of you who have read The World is Flat by Tom Friedman, this book should be a natural continuation to the argument he makes.

>Renowned economist and bestselling author Tyler Cowen explains that phenomenon: High earners are taking ever more advantage of machine intelligence in data analysis and achieving ever-better results. Meanwhile, low earners who haven’t committed to learning, to making the most of new technologies, have poor prospects. Nearly every business sector relies less and less on manual labor, and this fact is forever changing the world of work and wages. A steady, secure life somewhere in the middle—average—is over.

>With The Great Stagnation, Cowen explained why median wages stagnated over the last four decades; in Average Is Over he reveals the essential nature of the new economy, identifies the best path forward for workers and entrepreneurs, and provides readers with actionable advice to make the most of the new economic landscape. It is a challenging and sober must-read but ultimately exciting, good news. In debates about our nation’s economic future, it will be impossible to ignore.

Seems like a thought provoking read. Will low-wage workers become insignificant? Some of these ideas seem radical and yet somewhat realistic looking at the pace at which technology is progressing. I would hate for a world where people with lower incomes are treader unequally. How well does this book apply to more socialistic economies? I'll just have to read it to find out. Let's see what the experts are saying in a few days.
